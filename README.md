## Income Calc

In this practical, I have created a basic Excel spreadsheet that serves as a tool for performing fundamental financial calculations, such as summing up values and determining net income. The primary objective of this task was to practice using Excel functions and formulas to analyze financial data and automate calculations.

Key features of the spreadsheet include:

1. Sum Calculation: The SUM function has been applied to calculate the total of various financial data entries, such as revenues or expenses.

2. Net Income Calculation: Using basic subtraction formulas, the net income has been calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue, providing an overall measure of profitability.

3. Formatting and Presentation: The spreadsheet includes formatting elements like bold headers, currency formatting for financial figures, and simple conditional formatting to highlight critical values like negative balances.

Through this practical, I have strengthened my skills in using Excel's built-in functions and improved my ability to perform basic financial analysis efficiently. This practical serves as a foundation for more complex data analysis tasks in the future.
